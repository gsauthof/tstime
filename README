Repository contains 2 programs:
- tstime
  
  'time(1)'-like command - but in addition to the runtime it also
  prints the highwater memory usage of the controlled process

- tsmon

  prints the runtime/highwater memory usage of every process which is
  exiting on the system until the tsmon is quit

Warning: The usage of tsmon is dangerous. Suddenly, you know for example that
'psi' consumes 32 MB rss, 'bash' forks 5 processes for each time you hit TAB
or that hald does a lot of forking from time to time.


Suprisingly, it is difficult to get the highwater memory usage
information under Linux (situation is similair on Solaris).

There are different approaches to solve this problem:

1. For rss highwater just use the ru_maxrss field from struct rusage (see
   getrusage(2) or wait3(2)). Unfortunetely  POSIX does not specify it
   and currently (2.6.27) Linux does not write this field
   (Solaris does not, too; AIX, BSD are reported to write this information)

2. Sample from /proc during the lifetime of the watched process. Yes, this is
   polling. The old tool 'memtime' does this. Of course, this approach is ultra
   ugly and not suitable for short running processes.

3. Use the taskstat delay accounting API from the Linux 2.6 Kernel.
   For tsmon this is a perfect fit. But to get the taskstats information
   of a single exiting process there is a bit overhead involved:
   you have to retrieve the exit information of all exiting processes
   (and ignore it) until the watched process exits.

   see tstime.c for details

About 1:

From time to time patches are sent to the lkml to support ru_maxrss.
AFAIK, until now nothing got applied.
